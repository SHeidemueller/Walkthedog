#Walk The Dog 

This is an app for the Pebble Smartwatch written in <a href="http://developer.getpebble.com/docs/pebblejs/">pebble.js</a> using the <a href="https://cloudpebble.net">CloudPebbble IDE</a>.

This is an complementary to the <a href="http://www.whistle.com/activity-monitor/">Whistle Activity Monitor</a> for Dogs from Whistle Labs.

So we are combining two of the wearables on the market together.
If your dog is already hooked up with the Whistle all you need is some time and <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles</a>, because the Whistle API is unfortunately not documented. Play around with Charles and you will have your Whistle authentication code in no time. (don't hesitate to get in touch with me, if you come across issues). So pop in your auth code and youâ€™re good to go.
This pebble app will give you the important stats associated with your dogs in your whistle account. You will get a list of all available dogs and then an Overview of the active minutes for the current day, activity goal and the battery level of the Whistle itself.

Please keep fair use in mind as this not an open API and it should only be used for personal use.
